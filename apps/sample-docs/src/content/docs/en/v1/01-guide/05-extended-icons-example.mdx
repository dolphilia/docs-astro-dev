# Built-in Icon Components

This guide demonstrates how to use the built-in icon components in your documentation.

## Built-in Icons

The basic `Icon` component provides a set of built-in icons:

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 1rem;">
  <Icon name="info" />
  <Icon name="warning" />
  <Icon name="error" />
  <Icon name="success" />
</div>

For more details on the built-in icons, see the [Icons Example](/en/v1/guide/icons-example) page.

## Using Icons in Text

Icons can be used inline with text:

This is an information <Icon name="info" /> message.

This is a warning <Icon name="warning" color="#ffc107" /> message.

This is an error <Icon name="error" color="#dc3545" /> message.

## Accessibility

For accessibility purposes, you can provide a label for the icon:

<Icon name="info" label="Information" />

When a label is provided, the icon will be announced by screen readers. Without a label, the icon is treated as decorative and will be ignored by screen readers.
